# Customer-Relationship-Manager
Internship Project for SLCC Web Development Certificate Program
This website has been created to show my skills and understanding of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL that I have learned from the Web
Development certificate program at Salt Lake Community College. As such, the company's name and logo are complete fabrications created by me for this project,
and do not reflect any currently operating business.

I had been tasked with creating a website that a data analytics company could use to gather information using surveys. For this project in particular, there
only needed to be one survey comparing Coke and Pepsi, and the results needed to be accessible only to someone with the proper credentials. In a real world
setting the results would not be visible to anyone who has access to the main site, but for these purposes the link to the Results page is included in the
navigation bar at the top of every page to show I had done the work. The Home page reflects any homepage you may view, the About Us page says more about the
company and its employees (which like the company itself are my creations), and the Newsletter page is for allowing users to sign up for a weekly newsletter.

As I am still fairly new to web development, the rest of the PHP files that aren't part of the five main pages of the site are there to test and error-check
the portions of the site that have the bulk of the backend code. The newsletter_table page was included as a precaution--as it is not required for the grade I
am unsure if it needed to be created in the first place but did so anyway. The design of the website is fairly minimal by choice--I personally prefer a
minimalistic approach.

I hope this project can show what I've learned over the past few months, and am open to any constructive criticisms as I continue to learn.
