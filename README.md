# Personal Website
This website and all of the pages included were created by me, using the skills I learned in the Web Development Certificate Courses
through Salt Lake Community College and continued studies in my own free time. The program focused mainly on HTML5, CSS3/Bootstrap, 
Javascript, PHP, and MySQL. The main website holds the basics, with the main focus being on the Portfolio section, which holds links 
to other pages and sources based on the Final Projects for both the Web Developmentand UX/UI Development Certificate Courses, along 
with smaller projects as I continue my studies with the aforementioned skills with the inclusion of C# and React as well.
